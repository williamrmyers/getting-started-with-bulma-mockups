This seems to work with react, but documentation on how to customize it is lacking.

Nothing fucking works unless you wrap it in section tags.

Regular Examples
https://bulma.io/documentation

None of their fucking examples work in real life, so use these.

Use the "content" class of fucking none of the styles H1 etc will work.
